# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Version tags are `vX.Y.Z`. A GitHub Release via `gh release create` is required at cut time (see [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md)).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Default [mise.toml](mise.toml) with common-dev tool pins: Ruby 3.4.10, Node 24.18.0 (LTS), Yarn 1.22.22, Python 3.13.14 (`task warm` installs when this dir is the project)
- Starter [Gemfile](Gemfile) / [Gemfile.lock](Gemfile.lock): Rails ~> 8.1.3, RuboCop ~> 1.88, Brakeman ~> 8.0 (`task warm` runs `bundle install`)
- Sample [package.json](package.json) / [yarn.lock](yarn.lock) (`ms`) and [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (`requests`) for warm
- [scripts/smoke.sh](scripts/smoke.sh) post-setup checks (tools + cache env); README Sample project path

### Changed

### Fixed

- `bin/shell` always requests a Docker TTY and starts `bash -il` / `zsh -il` so the shell is interactive (shows a prompt). Missing `-t` left bash non-interactive with no PS1.

### Security
